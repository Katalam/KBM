DISARM:
-------
 1. ----> ID THE DEVICE
 (currently just the one type/level) Start
 with the center chip. Read the Serial #.

 If it starts with L1, then its a "LEVEL 1".
 Also known as an "L1" Device.

 ALL Level 1's just need a specific wire
 OR location CUT to DISARM. Basic. Simple.


 2. ----> DECODE SERIAL #
          Format: AB | C | D | E

  A = ID (L Series; L10, L11, L1B, L1?, etc.)
  B = Direction (Normal, Reversed, Battey, Other)
  C = Code 1 (ADD all "l"s and SUBTRACT all "L"s)
  D = Wire (Which WIRE to CUT)
  E = Code 2 (ADD all "l"s and SUBTRACT all "L"s)

  ie. L10|Ll2F|2RT|G5i

  Reads:
  A = Type "L1" ............( 1 Wire to Cut )
  B = 0 is Normal ..........( standard disarm )
  C = 1l - 1L = 0 ..........( +1 -1 = 0 )
  D = 2RT ..................( 2nd RED from TOP )
  E = nul or 0 .............( no l's nor L's )

 3. ----> CUT WITH ESD* SAFE SNIPS!
 	  (place mouse-cursor TIP on Wire CENTER)

	  *ESD = Electro-Static-Discharge
		 (usually ceramic, plastic, etc.)

		 Safe to use on electronics, but
		 weaker than metal; may break.




 EXAMPLE:

 *This would be a "L" Type Device. You MUST
 decode the Serial# to determine which wire
 to cut. IF an "L" device, start with the
 WIRE part of the code. In this case, it is
 the Second Red Wire from the Top (2RT). IF
 it was reversed, it would be the second Red
 from the BOTTOM.

 L10 = Level 1 Normal
 L11 = Level 1 Reversed

 Then ADD/SUBTRACT all the "L"s you read in
 BOTH C and E part of the chip Serial #.
 ADD ALL lower case l's and then SUTRACT ALL
 upper case "L"s.

 ADD THAT to the WIRE Number! In this case
 they would cancel out. One lower case l
 minus one upper case L equals 0. +1-1=0

 2RT plus 0 equals 2RT. ((2+0)RT)

  (IF there were two lower case l's minus one
  upper case L's, it would equal 1, which you
  would ADD to the 2RT, which then becomes 3RT.
  You would CUT the Thrid RED Wire from the TOP)
